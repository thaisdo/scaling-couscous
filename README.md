ðŸ›’ **Amazon Clone**  
Project developed as part of the Integrative Project at the University.

**About the Project**  
This project is a functional clone of the Amazon website, developed independently using ReactJS.

<div align="justify">
    
> My project is a functional website that is a clone of the Amazon website, built entirely by me using ReactJS. The website includes a home page and a cart page, and I implemented a data layer using both Context API and Redux to manage the state of the application. I've implemented a login page that will allow users to log in and create accounts. User authentication will be handled using Firebase, a popular backend service that provides authentication, database, and storage services. Once the login page is implemented, users will be able to create accounts, log in, and access their personal account information. Firebase will be used to validate user accounts and ensure that only authorized users are able to access certain features of the website. I'm proud to say that I completed this project entirely on my own, which is a testament to my skills and dedication to learning new technologies.
